            <h2>Collaborator</h2> 
            <span>Collaborators are individuals with outgoing and expressive personalities.  They are sociable, friendly, and thrive in group settings.  They are excellent communicators, and prefer leveraging teamwork to complete tasks, rather than tackling them alone.  Collaborators are well suited for workspaces that offer open offices that keep them in constant contact with their peers, bolstering opportunities for group collaboration on tasks.</span>

                    <p>Software Engineers are great for collaborators because most software engineers work in teams on a daily bases. They are constantly communicating and sharing ideas on what and hows of software engineering. Software Engineers write, debug, maintain, and test software that instructs a computer to accomplish certain tasks, such as saving information, performing calculations, etc.
    While many are self taught, most software engineers have obtained an undergraduate or graduate degree in computer science or computer engineering. The career of a software engineer typically follows one of two primary paths: they either progress through greater responsibility and ownership over technical architecture and systems or they progress into managing teams of software engineers and help orchestrate larger projects and help develop and mentor more junior engineers.</p>
