        <h1>SCENARIO:</h1>
        <p>You are an employee working at a large retailer during the holiday season.
        <br>You notice that one of your colleagues that you aren't close with has not 
        <br>been performing as well as he usually does. Your colleague appears stressed, 
        <br>is working sloppily, and is very curt with customers.
        </p>
        <h2> How do you react in the above situation?</h2>

            <input type="radio" name="Selection" id="1" onclick="getit()" required/>
            <label for="1">Report his performance issues to your supervisor. It is not your job to help fix his issues.</label><br><br>
            <input type="radio" name="Selection" id="2" onclick="getit()" required/>
            <label for="2">Try to talk to him and see what is going on. He may just need someone to talk to.</label><br><br>

            <label for="5">Advise him that he needs to step it up. It's the busy season and his slack is hurting everyone else working.</label>
